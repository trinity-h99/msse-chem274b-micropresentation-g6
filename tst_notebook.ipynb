    "# Analysis of the Sickle Cell Data\n",
    "After extracting the exons from the HBB_region.fasta and joining them together, we converted the sequence into a continuous cDNA starting from the first ATG—the translation start site of β-globin. Because the coordinate system is now “protein-coding only”, every nucleotide position in the output corresponds directly to codons in the mRNA, not the original genomic positions. After generating the final 386-bp cDNA, we searched for the “GTG” codon. Several GTG sites showed up, which is normal because valine occurs multiple times throughout the β-globin protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the GTG located around position 17 is important is that this is the codon corresponding to the classical sickle-cell mutation. In the beta-globin gene, sickle-cell disease is caused by a single A to T substitution that converts the sixth amino-acid codon from GAG (Glu) to GTG (Val). Since each codon is three nucleotides, the sixth codon starts around nucleotide positions 16–18 in the cDNA. That is why the code identifies a GTG at the position 17: among all GTG hits, this specific one represents the disease-causing mutation hotspot."

    "# Why TST Is Still Useful for Codon Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the time-complexity expression for a TST looks a bit heavy at first, it does not mean the method is worse than brute-force. In practice, a TST becomes faster because it does not restart the entire comparison at every position in the genome. Instead, it reuses its branching structure to guide each search.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This helps especially when we need to search for multiple codons or motifs. Brute-force has to scan through the whole sequence again for every single pattern, but a TST uses the same tree for all queries. For P patterns, TST has `O(P × M)` time complexity, which is much more efficient than brute-force's `O(P × N × M)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, a TST is a good fit for biological sequences where we often look for several codons or variants at once. After the tree is built, each additional lookup becomes very fast compared to scanning the whole genome again.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applying It to the E. coli **lacZ** Gene\n",
    "\n",
    "To show this behavior more clearly, we apply our TST implementation to the *E. coli* **lacZ** gene. The goal is to search for multiple GTG codons (and potentially other patterns) inside a real gene, not just a small toy example.  \n",

    "Using a real sequence like **lacZ** highlights when the TST starts to outperform simple brute-force:  \n",

    "- and we avoid re-scanning the entire sequence every time.\n",
