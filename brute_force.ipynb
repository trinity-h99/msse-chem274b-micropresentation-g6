This interval includes the entire HBB gene, all of its exons and introns, and the surrounding 5′ and 3′ flanking regulatory DNA. Most importantly, this region contains codon 6 of the HBB gene, where the classic sickle-cell mutation occurs (the DNA change GAG → GTG, causing Glu → Val in the protein). Because this FASTA segment captures the complete gene plus adjacent regulatory sequences, it provides everything we need for searching and detecting the sickle-cell mutation.\n",
